Hierarchical Clustering
Hierarchical clustering is a method of cluster analysis which seeks to build a hierarchy of clusters. It is used in unsupervised machine learning for clustering problems where the goal is to group similar data points together. Unlike K-Means clustering, hierarchical clustering does not require you to specify the number of clusters in advance.

There are two types of hierarchical clustering:

Agglomerative Clustering (Bottom-up approach): Starts with each point as its own cluster and merges the closest pairs of clusters step by step.
Divisive Clustering (Top-down approach): Starts with all data points in one cluster and splits them into smaller clusters recursively.
In this tutorial, we'll focus on Agglomerative Clustering, which is more commonly used.

How Hierarchical Clustering Works
Initialization: Treat each data point as a single cluster.
Merging: At each step, find the pair of clusters that are closest to each other and merge them. This is done based on a distance metric (e.g., Euclidean distance).
Stopping Criterion: Repeat until all points are merged into a single cluster or until a desired number of clusters is reached.
The results of hierarchical clustering are usually presented in a dendrogram, which visually represents the merging process.

Linkage Criteria
The choice of linkage criteria determines how the distance between clusters is calculated. Common linkage methods include:

Single Linkage: The minimum distance between points in different clusters.
Complete Linkage: The maximum distance between points in different clusters.
Average Linkage: The average distance between points in different clusters.
Ward's Method: Minimizes the variance within clusters, aiming to produce clusters with small variances.
